<h1>Chicken Parm</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While developing this recipe, I wondered: Why are we, citizens of the world, so obsessed with chicken Parmesan? After discussing with the food team, testing multiple variations, and summoning various Italian (-American) gods, I realized the reason is simple: It’s fatty, umami-licious, and has that perfect crispy AND melt-in-your-mouth texture. Though we’ve done it many different ways here, this classic recipe is the chosen one, the holy grail. It has everything you want in chicken Parm, full stop—fried cutlets shrieking with crispiness, a perfect blend of mozzarella and Parm, and a sauce that is full of life with basil and just enough sweetness. </p>
<p>“So I made this for my parents for a 'romantic date night' for a surprise, and the instructions were so well-detailed it was super easy to follow (I'm 12), so thank you so much, as the other recipes online were much more confusing!!”</p>
